# Training Sparse Neural Networks using Compressed Sensing

Contains code which implements the training of compressed neural networks
using an adaptively weighted l1-norm based on similar techniques from compressed
sensing. Test cases are unstructured and structured sparsity on the CIFAR datasets
using a variety of architectures. Details can be found in the paper: .

Each experiment is set to run on the GPU by default and hyperparameters are set to
value which reproduce the experimental results presented in the above paper.
