# Training Sparse Neural Networks using Compressed Sensing

Contains code which implements the training of compressed neural networks
using an adaptively weighted l1-norm based on similar techniques from compressed
sensing. Test cases are unstructured and structured sparsity on the CIFAR datasets
using a variety of architectures. Details can be found in the paper: .
